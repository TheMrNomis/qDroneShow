# qDroneShow
qDrone show is a show plannification software for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Its goal is to be able to plan a show (by telling the software how many UAVs are in the show, where to put them, and what moves the UAVs should do), and then to "play" the show by monitoring the UAVs moves and status in real-time.
